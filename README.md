# smart-watering-system

Automate the process of watering your flower and get a relaxed mind as you would never be in a haste or worried that you forgot to water your flowers before leaving home 

## Components needed

| Name | Qty |
| :---: | :---: |
| Arduino uno | 1 |
| Buzzer | 1 |
| 16 * 2 lcd | 1 |
| 12v dc pump | 1 |
| Push button | 2 |
| 10k resistor | 3 | 
| Potentiometer | 1 |
| Soil moisture | 1 |
| Ultrasonic sensor | 1 |
| Tip41c (NPN transistor) | 1 |
| 12v dc power supply | 1 |

### Note 

- In this project i'm going to be making use of a custom soil moisture sensor which you can easily create at home

  - Check here to know how to make a custom soil moisture sensor[^1]
  - Click here for schematic with geninue soil moisture [^2]

- The two push button used in the projection are dual functioned enabled

| Arduino pin | use |
| :----: | :----: |
| pin 3 | custom RX pin |
| pin 4 | custom TX pin |
| pin 5 | turn relay on and off |

[^1]: Since soil moisture deals with measuring the conductivity of the soil it can easily be reproduced. To do this simply Connect a 10k ohm resistor to your analouge signal pin and then to ground after which you take out jumpers from your 5v power supply and from the signal pin you pulled down with the 10k ohm resistor. If you're correct, you're circuit should be looking like this as i am currently using an led to indicate the two wires that are meant to go into your soil                                        ![moisture sensor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65239245/185814108-e13458bc-3dc3-41fa-a580-5545dfe56310.png)
