### Note 

- In this project i'm going to be making use of a custom soil moisture sensor which you can easily create at home

- Check here to know how to make a custom soil moisture sensor [^1]
[^1]: test

- Click here for schematic with custom soil moisture [^2]

## Usage 

- Download the project [zip](https://github.com/n1lby73/smart-watering-system/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

- Extract the project and save it in a folder with any name of your choice 

- Open up the *.ino file with [arduino ide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

- Upload and wire your circuit using the schematics below

<!-- ### Schematic notation

- > & + ==> switch for next and increasing values

- < & - ==> switch for previous selection and decreasing values

- + pulldown ==> pulldown resistor for the increase button

- - pulldown ==> pulldown resistor for the decrease button

- Contrast ==> potetiometer to vary lcd contrast -->
