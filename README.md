# smart-watering-system

Automate the process of watering your flower and get a relaxed mind as you would never be in a haste or worried that you forgot to water your flowers before leaving home 

## Components needed

| Name | Qty |
| :---: | :---: |
| Arduino uno | 1 |
| Buzzer | 1 |
| 16 * 2 lcd | 1 |
| 12v dc pump | 1 |
| Push button | 2 |
| 10k resistor | 3 | 
| Potentiometer | 1 |
| Soil moisture | 1 |
| Ultrasonic sensor | 1 |
| Tip41c (NPN transistor) | 1 |
| 12v dc power supply | 1 |

### Note 

soil moisture sensor is not a compulsory compnent to get as we are going to be making use of a custom soil moisture in this project

<!-- ### Schematic notation

- > & + ==> switch for next and increasing values

- < & - ==> switch for previous selection and decreasing values

- + pulldown ==> pulldown resistor for the increase button

- - pulldown ==> pulldown resistor for the decrease button

- Contrast ==> potetiometer to vary lcd contrast -->
